In this repo you can find some scripts I wrote over the time to make the old Reddit UI better (for myself).

* MarkDuplicates - Useful for multireddits, it attempts to find duplicates and marks them orange
* RemoveTitleTextPostsLinks - Remove the links from the title of text posts, make it easier to copy them
